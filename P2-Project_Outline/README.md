# Project Outline


### Overview
Have you ever left your doctors office and mentally 
kicked yourself for forgetting symptoms that you 
wanted to bring up in the appointment? 

### Features
~User Login:Users are able to create accounts, login, and view infomation.
~Add symptom:Users will be able to add a new symptom to the list.
~Delete symptom: Users will be able to delete symptoms or clear list.

### Technologies
This application will utilize, C#, HTML,Javascript, and Visual Studio.

### What I'll Have to Learn
For this project, I will need to learn Javascript. I hope to use Javascript for 
the add feature. I hope to utilize forms allowing the user to select areas in an 
image to auto-complete the form.
